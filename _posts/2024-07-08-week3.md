# Week 3: Unforeseen Challenges

## COVID-19 Strikes

This week took an unexpected turn as I caught COVID-19 for the first time. Unfortunately, I contracted it from a member of my research team who had also fallen ill. As a result, the majority of our team was home sick with COVID-19.

## Impact on Research

Due to the illness, I spent the entire week in bed and was unable to perform any research or make progress on our projects. It was a challenging time for all of us, as being sick not only affected our health but also our ability to collaborate and move forward with our work.

## Looking Ahead

As I recover, I am optimistic about getting back on track with our research. The team is also eager to resume our projects once everyone is healthy again. I look forward to sharing more updates and progress in the coming weeks.
