# Week 3: Setting Up ROS and Franka Arm

## Installing Dependencies and Overcoming Challenges

This week, I focused on setting up a computer to run ROS (Robot Operating System) and the Franka arm dependencies with Ubuntu 20.04. The process was quite challenging as I encountered several issues getting everything installed, similar to the struggles I faced last year. Despite these difficulties, I managed to get the system up and running.

## Research and Learning

In addition to the technical setup, I spent a considerable amount of time reading supporting research papers. This research is crucial for understanding the underlying principles and methodologies that will inform my project work with the Franka robotic arm. The insights gained from these papers are invaluable as I proceed with my research and development tasks.
