# Week 7: Setting Up a New System with Ubuntu, Real-Time Kernel, and ROS 1

## Task: Preparing a Second Laptop

This week, I was tasked with setting up a second laptop with **Ubuntu 20.04**, a **real-time kernel**, and **ROS 1**. The assumption was that the **Franka Research 3** required a real-time kernel, and that **ROS 2** wouldn’t be compatible with the hardware. Therefore, I needed to prepare this system using ROS 1.

## Challenges and Learning

I faced numerous challenges while trying to build a real-time kernel on Ubuntu. As a novice in **Linux**, I spent the entire week diving into the technical details of:

1. **Real-time kernels**: Understanding why real-time performance is necessary for robotics and how to configure it.
2. **ROS 1**: Learning about its setup, differences from ROS 2, and troubleshooting issues.
3. **Linux System Configuration**: Gaining hands-on experience with system installation, configuration, and problem-solving.

Although I didn’t fully resolve all the issues, I made significant progress in understanding how these components work together. It was a challenging but valuable learning experience, and I feel more confident in navigating Linux and ROS systems moving forward.
