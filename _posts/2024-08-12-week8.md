# Week 8: Switching to Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS 2

## Transition to Ubuntu 22.04

This week, I made the decision to abandon **Ubuntu 20.04** and switch to **Ubuntu 22.04** due to its built-in **real-time kernel**. The real-time kernel in 22.04 can be activated with just two commands, which made the setup much more efficient compared to the difficulties I faced trying to build it manually in 20.04.

## ROS 2 and Real-Time Kernel Setup

After installing **Ubuntu 22.04** and activating the **real-time kernel**, I began working with **ROS 2**. I successfully set up ROS 2 with the real-time kernel and started integrating the **Franka ROS 2 dependencies**.

## Workspace and Dependency Challenges

Despite the progress with the system setup, I encountered significant issues when trying to create a proper workspace for working with the **Franka arm**. The dependencies required for the **Franka ROS 2** package were particularly challenging, and I spent much of the week troubleshooting and learning how to get the necessary packages installed correctly in the workspace. 

It was a frustrating process, but Iâ€™m pushing forward to resolve the issues and get everything working smoothly.
