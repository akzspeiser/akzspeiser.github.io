# Week 9: Struggling to Move the Robot with ROS 2

## Trying to Move the Franka Arm

This week, I focused on trying to get my code to move the robot and connect it to **ROS 2**. I used a computer that was already connecting to the robot and worked on refining my code. My main goal was to load the **joint_trajectory_controller** and configure it properly.

## Learning ROS 2 Components

Throughout the week, I spent a significant amount of time learning more about how **ROS 2** loads components and how to work with **Xacro**, **URDF**, and **YAML** files. I tried multiple configurations and methods to get the arm moving, but ran into difficulties due to the fact that the system was set up to only **receive and save data** from the **Franka Research 3** rather than to move it.

## Challenges and Reflections

Despite trying everything I could think of, I wasn’t able to get the arm to move. The process was a steep learning curve, especially as I’m still a novice in the world of robotics. I now realize I need more time and experience to successfully implement these types of robotic control systems.
