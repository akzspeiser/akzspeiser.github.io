# Week 5: Struggles with Data Conversion

## Tasked with Extracting Robot Data

This week, I was assigned the task of extracting and converting robot data from a **.db3** file to a more usable format. The goal was to eventually work with an **MCAP** file format that could be opened using Foxglove. However, the process proved to be more challenging than expected.

## Python Conversion Attempts

I spent a significant amount of time trying to use Python to convert the **.db3** file into an **MCAP** file, but kept running into various errors along the way. I tried multiple methods to make the conversion work, but none of them led to the desired result. Early on, I managed to convert the data into a **CSV** file, but I thought CSV wouldnâ€™t contain everything we needed, so I abandoned it in favor of other methods.

## Lessons Learned

After many attempts and errors, I eventually realized that **CSV** was actually sufficient for our needs. My graduate student mentor, who gave me the task, was able to successfully convert the data to CSV and extract everything he needed. I realized I should have stuck with the CSV method from the start, but this experience taught me a lot about **.db3**, **MCAP**, and **CSV** file formats. In the end, the task was completed, and I gained valuable insight into data conversion processes.
