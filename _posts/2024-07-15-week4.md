# Week 4: Writing the Application Code

## Getting Started with Python and Vosk

This week, I focused heavily on writing the Python code for the application. The first component I tackled was the voice recognition functionality using **Vosk**, a lightweight speech recognition toolkit. Vosk is well-suited for running offline, which is perfect for our needs. I integrated the voice recognition successfully into the code and began implementing basic robot commands.

## Text-to-Speech Integration

Alongside Vosk, I added a **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** dependency to allow the robot to provide verbal feedback after executing commands. This functionality enhances the interaction by allowing the robot to respond with confirmation once a task is completed or when an error occurs. This step proved to be a key part of making the system more user-friendly and intuitive.

## Connecting to the Robot via ROS2

Once the voice recognition and TTS components were in place, I moved on to connecting the code to the robotic arm using **ROS2**. This allowed me to start writing the action commands for the robot. I added three key actions into the script:

1. **Poke Object**: The robot will extend its arm to poke an object based on the given command.
2. **Reset Position**: After performing a task, the robot will return to its home position.
3. **End Program**: This command will safely shut down the entire system when needed.

## Progress Without Testing

While I was able to write the code for the voice recognition, TTS, and ROS2 robot actions, I didnâ€™t have the opportunity to test it yet. However, having these core functionalities written brings me one step closer to a fully functional system.
