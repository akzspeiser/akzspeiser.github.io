# Week 10: Prototype Development and Voice Recognition Challenges

## Working on the Program Prototype

This week, I focused on trying to get a prototype of the program I’m developing. I ran into several issues with **Vosk** and may end up switching to different speech recognition software I’ve found. The main problem was that it struggled to recognize even simple terms correctly.

## Voice Recognition and Text-to-Speech Progress

Despite the issues with voice recognition, the **text-to-speech** functionality is working great. I was finally able to get the application to recognize the activation phrase "**hey robot**" and then ask for further commands. For instance, it can recognize the phrase "**poke object**" within a sentence like "**Can you please poke those two objects over there and tell me which is softer**." However, this was just a mock-up, as I still couldn’t get the robot to move.

Another command I implemented was "**reset your position**," where the system responds when the robot is in the default position. When I give the shutdown command, it responds with "**Go Beavs**" (our mascot) and then says "**Goodbye**" before shutting down the program.

## Adding a Video

I recorded a video demonstrating the application’s functionality. You can watch it below:

That's all folks! I hope you enjoyed my adventure this summer. Tune in next year for more updates.
