# Week 6: Paper Formatting and Notation

## Working on the Published Paper

This week, my focus was on preparing the final draft of the paper my team had been working on, titled **"‘Scrape That Barnacle’: Commanding Underwater Robot In-Contact Manipulation Tasks with Intuitive Spatial-Temporal-Force Features"**. The paper, co-authored by **Ramya Challa**, **Hunter Brown**, **Chirag Jain**, **Zachary Speiser**, and **Heather Knight**, is now published, and I was responsible for ensuring that the formatting followed the **IEEE standards**. This involved meticulous attention to detail to ensure that every section adhered to the formatting guidelines required for publication.

## Notation Work

In addition to the formatting, I worked on the **notation** used in the paper, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout the document. Proper notation is essential for effectively communicating our research, especially in a technical paper. This was a crucial step in making sure our results and methodology were presented accurately.

## First Published Paper

An exciting personal milestone—this is the **first published paper** with my name on it! I'm thrilled to have been part of such a significant achievement with my team.

The paper is now available on my **[index page](index.html)** for viewing.
